    <h2 class="text-primary">PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
        <p>I am a 22 year old software developer looking for a new role that will provide ample opportunity to learn more and further myself as a developer. My core understanding and passion for programming was founded around building scripts and small projects in python for a raspberry pi. </p>    
        <p>I’ve since moved in the direction of web development and have thoroughly enjoyed my personal learning progression along the way. I hope to bring these skills into a new role where I can have an impactful contribution from the start. </p>    

        <hr class="my-4 ">
    <h2 class="text-primary">SKILLS</h2>
        <p>My strengths include the ability to learn autonomously, as well as collectively, and ability to gain the necessary skills needed for the specific task. I’m eager and enjoy learning about new technologies that I can apply to current and future projects. </p>

        <h5 class="text-muted">Front-end</h5>
        <p>I have experience building websites with the standard front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). I’ve also used bootstrap in my portfolio website and for projects in my current role as a software developer. </p>
        <p>As well as developing, I have also enjoyed learning about design and user experience. I have experience creating designs in Figma which has helped me throughout my professional journey, especially when communicating new features to non-technical members of staff. </p>
        <h5 class="text-muted">Back-end</h5>
        <p>At my current role I’ve been predominantly using PHP to build web applications. The most recent project was a staff portal. I have experience using and building SQL databases for web applications. I have recently been using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I also have experience collaborating on team projects using git and GitHub. 
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4 ">
    <h2 class="text-primary">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p>I am currently a software developer for BPM contracting services. I gained this role through the government’s kickstart scheme as a 6-month placement. The function of the software development team is to streamline the business operations and build new services that enable all aspects of the business to run efficiently. </p>
        <p>Throughout my time here I have been involved in migrating our database over from using mysql to PostgreSQL and then onto designing and developing the new staff portal. The staff portal has several features that provides a single place where employees can login to access training content, book and view holiday, view payment breakdown for contractors and more. </p>
        <p>
          I’ve volunteered for a homeless shelter charity. My role involved ensuring vulnerable adults had a hot meal for the night and any essentials they needed. My communication skills were crucial for working with the team and building a good rapport with the public. I regularly had to defuse situations and found that this role immensely helped improve my people skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to all of that, I was a self-employed delivery courier in Exeter. I always aimed to provide a good service that all parties can be satisfied with. Due to my contributions to the local rider and public community I am one of the few Deliveroo rider award winners 2021 chosen from across the UK.
