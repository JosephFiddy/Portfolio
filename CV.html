    <h2 class="text-primary">PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
        <p>I am a 22 year old software developer looking for a new role that will provide ample opportunity to learn more and further myself as a developer. My core understanding and passion for programming was founded around building scripts and small projects in python for a raspberry pi. </p>    
        <p>I’ve since moved in the direction of web development and have thoroughly enjoyed my personal learning progression along the way. I hope to bring these skills into a new role where I can have an impactful contribution from the start. </p>    

        <hr class="my-4 ">
    <h2 class="text-primary">SKILLS</h2>
        <p>My strengths include the ability to learn autonomously, as well as collectively. I’m eager and enjoy learning about new technologies that I can apply to current and future projects.</p>

        <h5 class="text-muted">Front-end</h5>
        <p>I have professional experience with the standard front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). I’ve also used bootstrap in this portfolio website and in projects during my time as a software developer.</p>
        <p>As well as developing, I have also enjoyed learning about design and user experience. I have experience creating designs in Figma which has helped me throughout my professional journey, especially when communicating new features to non-technical members of staff. </p>
        <h5 class="text-muted">Back-end</h5>
        <p>I have worked with C# and PHP across a range of projects. One of which was a CRUD web application that I took the lead on. I have since focused my own personal learning towards C# and .Net Core. I have experience designing and building SQL databases for web applications as an essential part of both of my roles as a software developer. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I also have experience collaborating on team projects using git and GitHub. 
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4 ">
    <h2 class="text-primary">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Junior Software Developer for Devon County Council. The function of the software development team is to build bespoke business solutions for other departments within the organisation. This gave me the opportunity to work on projects with such varied end-users. We primarily use a low-code tool called OutSystems alongside other standard technologies such as CSS/JavaScript/SQL.</p>
        <p>Prior to this role, I worked as a software developer for BPM contracting services on a 6-month contract. Throughout my time there I was involved in migrating the database over from using MySQL to PostgreSQL and then onto designing and developing a new staff portal application.  </p>
        <p>
          I’ve volunteered for a homeless shelter charity. My role involved ensuring vulnerable adults had a hot meal for the night and any essentials they needed. My communication skills were crucial for working with the team and building a good rapport with the public. I regularly had to defuse situations and found that this role immensely helped improve my people skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before starting my career as a software developer, I was a self-employed delivery courier in Exeter. I always aimed to provide a good service that all parties can be satisfied with. Due to my contributions to the local rider and public community I am one of the few Deliveroo rider award winners 2021 chosen from across the UK.
