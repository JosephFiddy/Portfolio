    <h2 class="text-primary">PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
        <p> As an aspiring software developer, I want to pursue my passion and land a role where I can learn and build upon my skills. I am currently doing a software development course and have also been studying it through online courses and projects in my own time.</br><br>I'm hoping to bring these skills into a new role and have an impactful contribution from the start.</p>

        <hr class="my-4 ">
    <h2 class="text-primary">SKILLS</h2>
        <p>My strength is the ability to learn autonomously, as well as collectively, and gain the necessary skills needed for the specific task. I’m eager and enjoy learning about new technologies that I can apply to current and future projects. </p>
        <p>I have experience building websites with the standard front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). I’m currently using these to build a construction website for a client. My core understanding has been built around python and have built several scripts designed to run on a raspberry Pi.</p>
        <p>I have completed courses in SQL and relational databases and hope to dive more into the backend of web development. – cater to current role

            Edit the rest of this section to apply more to the specific role.

    <h2 class="text-primary">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p>I’ve worked with a local software development company (Switch Systems) to gain an insight into how they develop software for their clients. I was a part of meetings and paired programming. I also had a chance to work with Git in a collaborative project using agile methodologies.</p>
        <p>I’ve volunteered for a homeless shelter charity. My role involved ensuring vulnerable adults had a hot meal for the night and any essentials they needed. My communication skills were crucial for working with the team and building a good rapport with the public. I regularly had to defuse situations and found that this role immensely helped improve my people skills.</p>
        <p>I have been a self-employed delivery courier in Exeter. I always aim to provide a good service that all parties can be satisfied with. Due to my contributions to the local rider and public community I am one of the few Deliveroo rider award winners 2021 chosen from across the UK. </p>
